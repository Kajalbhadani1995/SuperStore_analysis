Profit Loss Analysis

. To understand the profit and loss better, I grouped categories and profit and has Visulize it with Bar Plot which says Technology has the highest profit with $145,454.48 among all product categories. Among the sub-categories, Copiers earned the highest profit ($56,517.22) and Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies are in loss.

. To know more about profit by region, I used a pie plot to identify which state contributes SuperStore's profit. so, California contributes 39.7% ($83,381.93) profit which is higher than any other state. The worst-performing states are Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York City combined. 

Monthly Sales Trends

## Conclusion

After analyzing the SuperStore data, it’s clear that the business is overall profitable, but there are still areas that need improvement. Technology and sub-categories like Copiers are performing really well and bringing in the highest profit, while categories like Tables and Bookcases are causing losses.

California stands out as the strongest state in terms of profit contribution, whereas some regions like Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York are struggling and need attention. Another interesting observation is that most purchases happen in November, meaning there may be seasonal trends or promotional impacts.

Customer behaviour also shows that a few loyal customers are responsible for a significant share of sales and profit, but certain customers are still resulting in losses. Delivery time varies by product type, with some categories like Tables taking too long to reach customers, which may reduce customer satisfaction.

Overall, the store is performing well, but focusing on reducing losses, improving shipping times, and understanding regional sales differences can help increase profitability even further.
